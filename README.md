# Approx starting time at tee 1

A new Flutter project.

As marshall of a golf club I have to check tee times and the sequence of players. I get a list with starting times at tee one. If I meet an unknown players e.g. at tee 15 I have to approximate the duration of his/her game to find the player in my list.
My app help me with the calculation. I have to input tee and the starting intervall for a good guess.
